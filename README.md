# SQL_Studyings_3
As you can see from the file, I've continued my SQl journey by learning some other important funtions and  subqueries. We can write a subquery and assign a name for it. So we can use it later with its name in the main query. 

I've learnt to use DATEDIFF() function to calculate the difference between two dates. We can get the difference as different types of time such as day, week, year etc. Then I've learnt to use some functions that can work along with OVER() clause. (ROW_NUMBER() OVER(), RANK() OVER(), NTILE() OVER() etc)
